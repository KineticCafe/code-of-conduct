# Kinetic Commerce Open Source Code of Conduct

Version 2.0

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participating in Kinetic
Commerce [open source projects][kineticcafe], as well as steps to reporting
unacceptable behaviour.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and
expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of
conduct may be banned from participation on one or more Kinetic Commerce open
source projects.

We strive to:

- **Be friendly and patient.**

- **Be welcoming**: We strive to make participation in our projects
  a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
  caste, color, culture, education, ethnicity, family status, gender identity
  and expression, language, immigration status, level of experience, national
  origin, personal appearance, political beliefs, profession, race, religion,
  sex characteristics, sexual identity and orientation, socio-economic status,
  or visible or invisible disability.

- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might
  not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
  is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that to turn into personal
  attacks. It's important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

- **Be careful in the words that you choose**: we are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
  Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
  exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

  Behaviours that contribute to a positive environment include:

  - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
  - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
  - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
  - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
    mistakes, and learning from the experience
  - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
    overall community

  Unacceptable behaviours include, but are not limited to:

  - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
    advances of any kind
  - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political
    attacks
  - Public or private harassment
  - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
    address, without their explicit permission
  - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person
  - Discriminatory jokes and language
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

* **When we disagree, try to understand why**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
  disagreements constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of
  our community comes from its diversity. People from a wide range of
  backgrounds and may have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to
  understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.
  Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us
  anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from
  mistakes.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it
to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that
everyone is equal. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them
to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is
our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to
right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
body size, caste, color, culture, education, ethnicity, family status, gender
identity and expression, language, immigration status, level of experience,
national origin, personal appearance, political beliefs, profession, race,
religion, sex characteristics, sexual identity and orientation, socio-economic
status, or visible or invisible disability. We will not tolerate
discrimination based on any of the characteristics above.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—
please report it by contacting us via
[opensource-codeofconduct@kineticcommerce.com][]. All reports will be handled
with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
  there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account
  of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a
  publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC
  logger), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, someone will contact you personally. If the person who
is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves
from handling your incident. A representative will then review the incident,
follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to
respond. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
protecting victims of abuse.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the representative may take
any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our
community without warning.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Kinetic Commerce uses the following impact guidelines to determine the
consequences of actions they are reported or are observed and are deemed in
violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external
channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this
period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.
